          <p>BORN LVIV, UKRAINE IN 2000.</p>
          <p>IN 2016 I SAW RAF SIMONS FASHION COLLECTION, AND UNDERSTAND THAT I WANT TO CREATE MY CLOTHES TOO. I STARTED FROM SMALL, I HAD A DREAM THAT I HAD A COOL PAIRS OF BLACK JEANS WITH PIECES OFBLUE JEANS PATCHES ON THEM. I WOKE UP AND UNDERSTAND THAT WAS ONLY DREAM, I FIND MY OLD BORING JEANS AND TAKE MY BROTHERS BLUE DENIM, CUT THEM TO LITTLE PIECES. AND SEW THEM ON MY PANTS. ALL MY FRIEND SAID THAT MY PANTS ARE AWESOME AND WANT TO BUY THE SAME, SO I DECIDED TO START MAKING SOME CLOTHES.</p>
          <p>THE HISTORY STARTS ACCIDENTALLY, MY AIM FOR NOW IS NOT TO BE FAMOUS OR EARN MONEY, MY AIM IS TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD LOVE. I HAVE PASSION TO ART, DESIGN AND FASHION, WITH LAST BEING ITS MAIN OUTPUT AT THE MOMENT.<span class="redtext"> MY CLOTHES DOES NOT TIE ITSELF TO CERTAIN SUBCULTURES OR STYLES AND IS A DYNAMIC REFLECTION ON YOUTH FASHION.</span>
